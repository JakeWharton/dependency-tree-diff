# Dependency Tree Diff

An intelligent diff tool for the output of Gradle's `dependencies` task which always shows
the path to the root dependency.

```diff

 |    +--- com.squareup.sqldelight:runtime-jvm:1.4.0

+     \--- org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk7:1.3.72 -> 1.4.0 (*)
```

Unlike a normal `diff`, unchanged entries are displayed only when they are a parent dependency
to one that changed.

Compare the above diff to `diff -U 0`:

Note how there is no context as to what is affected.

In this particular sample we can reach the root dependencies with `diff -U 2`:

```

Now, however, additional unchanged dependencies are displayed such as `androidx.sqlite` and the
SQLDelight runtime dependency by the RxJava 2 extensions artifact.

For deep dependency chains, `-U 2` will not be enough to see all of the roots. Increasing the value
will only show more unchanged dependencies. `dependency-tree-diff` will always display the
minimal subset needed to provide context.

For more information about why a diff of the dependency tree is useful see
["Surfacing Hidden Change to Pull Requests"](https://developer.squareup.com/blog/surfacing-hidden-change-to-pull-requests/).

## Usage

The tool parses the output of Gradle's `dependencies` task. Specify `--configuration <name>` when
running the task so that only a single tree will be shown.

```
$ ./gradlew :app:dependencies --configuration releaseRuntimeClasspath > old.txt
$ # Update a dependency...
$ ./gradlew :app:dependencies --configuration releaseRuntimeClasspath > new.txt
```

### Diff

For diffing 2 dependency trees just use:
```
$ ./dependency-tree-diff.jar diff old.txt new.txt
```

In case you need flatten list of changed/added/removed libraries use --flatten arg:
```
$ ./dependency-tree-diff.jar diff --flatten old.txt new.txt
```

### Flatten dependency list

This tool can also transform diff tree to flatten list.  Just use:
```
$ ./dependency-tree-diff.jar flatten deps.txt
```

See `src/test/fixtures/` for example outputs and their expected diffs.

## Install
